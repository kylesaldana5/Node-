## Requirements

Create a JavaScript file to act as a Node.js program named `file-io.js`. This program
should accept a single argument which should be a file path. Executing the
program will print the contents of that file onto the terminal through the [stdout](http://node.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/process/#processstdout)
stream. Executing the program without an argument should simply return without
printing anything. This functionality to be similar to the `cat` command
